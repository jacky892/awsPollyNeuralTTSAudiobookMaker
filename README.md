# awsPollyNeuralTTSAudiobookMaker

No need to spend >$30 in-app-purchase to convert full text to audibook, use the AWS polly service to make audiobook for any text your want.
Just put your text file in 'txt' directory, run the python script (you will be asked for your AWS key which will be stored in the aws_cfg.ini) and you can get the audiobook as mp3 in the audiobooks directory.
